# Digit Recognize Board

<p align="justify">
developed a digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset and TensorFlow library, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for accurate model training. This system effectively identifies handwritten digits with high precision.

To enhance interactivity, I implemented the model in Python and integrated it with a Pygame-based whiteboard. This feature enables real-time digit recognition and provides a dynamic visualization experience.

## Steps
1) Run the Colab file<br><br>
   First, run the Colab file to create the model and find the accuracy, Then save the model.<br>
   You can save the model in two formats.<br><br>
   * advanced_digit_recognition_model.h5
   * advanced_digit_recognition_model.keras
2) Run the program<br><br>
   Before running the main program, insert your saved model in the model path.<br><br>
   <pre>
     <code>load_model("your_model")</code>
   </pre>
